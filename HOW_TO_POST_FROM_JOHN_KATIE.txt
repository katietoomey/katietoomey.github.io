For now these are the instructions for adding a new post to your blog

1. Add a markdown file inside the `posts` folder. You can call it whatever you want as long as you add .md at the end.
2. Write your blog post inside that new markdown file you made. Look up a markdown cheatsheet for help.
3. Link the new post on your index.md file just like you did with the example ones we did together. 
  a. - [The name of the post](posts/the_name_of_your_post.md)

Now you have a new post! The only problem is that it's only on your laptop and not on your actual website.
To put it on the website you're going to go through the steps that I showed you when we hung out 
  (Click `stage all` in that window, then write a little commit message, hit the `commit` button, and finally hit `push`)


This is your website so edit whatever you like. 
If you want to change the index.md page then go for it and format it however you want.
Unforunately, it won't be the most beautiful website of all time but it's a great way to blog for free. 
When you get rich and famous from writing and research you can hire me to make you a big fancy website 
with all of the bells and whistles :)
